# Resources

Resources are entities such as variables, credentials defined at the project level and can
be used in all schedulers.

There are currently **variables** and **ssh credential** resource types.

## Variable Resources

Variables are specified by a name and its value. Then, whenever you use it in text fields, the 
value will be replaced by the variable value at runtime.
A variable allows to define a concept and its value and reuse at multiple places, typically used for shared configurations.
And so if you need to change a configuration, it can be done once by modifying the variable.

In the scheduler fields (for example in text fields), we use the mustache framework, and so for example if you have a variable **MY_VARIABLE**, then in the text field you can use it as follows:

```sh
{{ MY_VARIABLE}}
```
## SSH Resources

An SSH resource is an SSH configuration credential allowing to connect to a remote SSH server.

SSH resources can be used in SSH schedulers, where you can select an SSH resource.

# Schedulers

A scheduler is the process which periodically executes a task or request.

## Schedule (crontab)

The periodic behaviour is based on the crontab format:

```sh
mm hh dm mo dw
```

where respectively the parts consist of:

- **mm**: minute (0-59)
- **hh**: hour (0-23)
- **dm**: day of month (1-31)
- **mo**: month (1-12)
- **hh**: hour (0-23)

And so if you want to run a task every minute, you'll write the following:

```sh
* * * * *
```

And every 10 minutes:

```sh
*/10 * * * *
```

## Scheduler types

We have different scheduler types depending on the technology you are planning to monitor/execute.

### HTTP

You can schedule HTTP/HTTPS requests and expect (by default) a successful status code.

### TCP

TCP-based schedulers allow to check if a given TCP port is listening or not.

### SSH

SSH schedulers use an existing SSH resource containing the credentials to connect to a remote
SSH server.

In this scheduler, a command needs to be specified, which will be run.

By default, it expects that the command ends with success (exit code 0).

## Operations

Schedulers can be updated, paused/unpaused, and you can also access the Grafana dashboard,
which provides detailed about the recurrent scheduling events.
